// Write a JavaScript function calcSupply(value) that accepts the following parameters: your age, your maximum age, 
// estimate amount of your favorite food per day (as a number). The function calculates how many of the food you will 
// eat for the rest of your life. Write JS program lifetimeSupplyCalc.js that calculates the amount of a few foods 
// that you will eat. The result should be printed on the console. Run the program through Node.js. Note: we assume 
// that there are no leap years. 

function calcSupply(age, maximumAge, amount ) {
